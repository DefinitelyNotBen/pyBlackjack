# pyBlackjack
This is a blackjack game that can be run on command line, simply run the main.py file and follow commands to play

The game simulates a blackjack table with a dealer and a player. The player is given chips to use as bets, once these chips are used up then the game ends

After each game, the user will have the option to stop playing

Typical blackjack rules apply, including the natural rule where if the first two cards are an ace or "10" card then the player / dealer will win if the other does not have this

Unless both players have blackjack at the start, a draw will end in the dealer winning. If both player and dealer have blackjack then the bet is returned

If the player wins the game then they win double the value of their bet, which is set at the start of every game
